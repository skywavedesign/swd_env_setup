# Sky Wave Design Setup Scripts
This repository has scripts to set up your environment to run supplied tools
## Linux
This is the primary supported operating system because of the ease in which 
setup can be scripted.  Also, it is easy to run in a virtual machine so dev
tools can always be run in a pristine environment

### To run a script
1. Change the permissions with `chmod +x script.sh`
2. Run the script with `sudo ./script.sh`

## Windows
TBD

## Mac OS X
